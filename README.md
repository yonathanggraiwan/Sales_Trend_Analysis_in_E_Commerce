## Problem Background
`I am a data analyst working in a department store. On this occasion, the store owner has asked me to analyze the annual sales data from their stores. I need to generate accurate analytical insights using statistics and create a visualization dashboard to answer key questions from the store executives.`

## Project Output
`The output of my project this time is a visualization dashboard of the data analysis results.`

## Data
`The data used in this project comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/data). This dataset contains e-commerce sales transaction trends, consisting of 3,900 rows and 17 columns. The data is considered 'clean' as there are no significant outliers and no missing values.`

## Method
`The data analysis methods used in this project are divided into two. The first is descriptive analysis, which applies descriptive statistical calculations, and the second is inferential analysis, which uses inferential statistical techniques. Finally, conclusions are drawn based on the results of these analyses.`

## Stacks
`The programming language used in this project is Python, with VSCode as the development tool. The libraries used include pandas, scipy, statistics, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express, and warnings. Data visualization is also presented using a Tableau dashboard.`
